# Blogs are great

Here is a blog post about how great blogs are. HTML is a great way to write content. You can add comments to your blog post with <a href="https://github.com/ascorbic/bluesky-comments-tag">the Bluesky comments tag</a>. Maybe you'd like to comment about it on Bluesky too.

There's a [theme playground](/theme) too

Use it like this:

```html
<bluesky-comments url="https://bsky.app/profile/mk.gg/post/3lbtkg6m7ys2v"></bluesky-comments>
<script type="module">
  import "https://esm.sh/bluesky-comments-tag/load";
</script>
```
